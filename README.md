# Fifa_Analysis

A python script that brings in data from the video game Fifa 19 and analyzes players based on certain attributes and assigns a value to them.

First the cript cleans the dataset to account for missing information, and handle all non numeric values in an effective manner. This includes turning the 15+ player positions into Attack, Midfield, Defense, or Goal Keeper.

Finds the best players at certain statistics.

Uses most important statistics to create a liner regression model to assign a value to the player in order to help create the best team without spending on overpriced players, similar to a "money ball" approach.
